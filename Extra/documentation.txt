<h4>Issues:</h4>
<p>There were a few issues whilst I was creating this website, most of them however came from silly spelling mistakes or forgetting semi-colons. The few other errors that I encountered were that I could not get my html patters to work properly no matter how hard I tried they would not work, I had to use these patterns so I could control what data goes into the database, meaning I would have two layers of protection, the HTML patterns and the SQL database controls, I found this site below which was created to help explain and create your own HTML patterns and then explains to you what the patterns you created do: http://html5pattern.com/Passwords alongside: w3schools. These sites helped explain the patterns and how to use them.</p>
<h4>Design:</h4> 
<p>To start with I chose a colour scheme, as the world all about dark mode and minimalism I chose to have a black and white design with small headers, small footers and larger content. Each page has its own image, this image is related to technology in some way. On top of this every page has its own introduction text on top of that image, usually related to what ever is on that specific page. Then beneath that there is the main content of the page, after this there is the footer. This is common layout of every page and does not change, the same layout is used on mobile and tablet designs too, however in those designs the image does not take up the entire page only a small section.

krugs principles of usability are a widely accepted standard that highlight how design should allow the user to do certain things, these things can be narrowed down to three specific things; “don’t make me think”, allowing the user to click until they wish to stop and removing unneeded words. Quite simply my website matches all of these categories, no matter what you are doing on the webpage there is always instructions, or it is beyond straight forward meaning the end user doesn’t have to think about anything specific on the webpage. My website also matches the word count principle, each page is given the exact amount of information that is required and very little more as to not confuse the end user. Finally, the inclusion of page swapping and a nav bar allows the user to search through the website for what they want!

My website can also be broken down against Nielsen’s principles, such as minimalism, my site shows the information that is needed to be shown and not much else, the user won’t be overwhelmed nor will they be lost. The user has complete control over the system being able to edit their data, add products to baskets and purchase what’s in the basket. However this does not mean there aren’t any error prevention tools and error recognition going on, in some situations the user can only choose from selected options to ensure they always get a correct response and in others when that is not possible error messages are shown if they do insert the incorrect information. There is also a set constant design all across the website that is not changed. And of course, due to the fact that my website follows the key common design principles users can use their prior knowledge of website design to navigate and use my website without having to rely on learning the layout or controls!

Database & PHP:
The database called: n2s contains 3 tables these are called: users – this contains all the information about the users that sign up. products – this contains all the information shown to the screen about the products. admin – this contains the log in data for the admins of the site.
The way I implemented PHP into my website was to have two separates external php files these were the files that changed the data in databases, set sessions and returned values. It would have been easier to have many more external php files, but I wanted to cut down on how many files there were in this project. Those two files are called userChange and adminChanges as you can see, I separated what the user can access and what the admins can access by using two separate php files alongside the separation of the two tables as mentioned earlier.</p>
<h4>Comparison:</h4>
<p>My biggest influence on my website was apple, their website is very aesthetically pleasing matching many of the principles we covered in the course; minimalism, a well-chosen colour scheme and a well laid out design. This is where I got my inspiration of the black and white colour scheme seeing how well apple had pulled it off. 
I also ensured that my website works similarly to other websites. Meaning that login functionality would ensure the user is logged in at all times and the basket would remain constant no matter what page the user is on. I used sessions to achieve this as opposed to cookies as security wise cookies are less secure than sessions and sessions means the user can stay logged in as long as the window is open which is long enough for a user to achieve what they wish using cookies right now would be un-necessary.
I also like the trend that most companies are following now that content is in the centre of the page (usually so companies can fit in ads but still I like it) as this means the user knows where the content is, because of this I decided to set anything I could to be centred.  On my products page my products are centred and if the page gets too small the products stack vertically in the centre. 
Of course I couldn’t go to apples website and check out what the admin site looks like but I decided that it would look much more robust and straight to the point than the users side of the webpage meaning the un-necessary things are removed like the footer, the header nav bar and all other functionality the admins wouldn’t need to use. I also separated the databases instead of adding a new column to maximise security.</p>
